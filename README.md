# TempoRun Song Finder Application

## Description

As a runner training for a marathon, I want to be able to set my pace as I train, with a song playlist. Our team decided to create an application that allows the user to search for a specified BPM (beats per minute), and save songs from the search results to a playlist.

We were able to leverage as well as build upon the skills we have learned so far. A few examples are:
- Planning and delegating tasks for application development
- Creating a smooth and intercative user experience
- Learning how to use new third-party APIs
- Managing GitHub branches with commits and pull request made by more than one user
